- This repo includes 1) HTML/CSS experiments, 2) websites, and 3) WebGL projects
- Please see the HTML experiments first:
    - These are in the directories cubeWork and modalWork
    - In these projects I have used HTML and CSS/SASS to practice a number of front-end techniques
    - Please see the README files for each individual project for details
- Please see the websites second:
    - These are UltimateCleanse, PulpAndPress, and FanshaweOnlineMarketingCompetition
    - The files here contain only the URLs of the sites, and a brief description. I could not include any code for privacy reasons.
- Please see the WebGL projects last
    - These are the reflectiveSpheres and floatingRectangles projects
    - I include these last because although they are predominantly Javascript, the WebGL API is less relevant to front-end development at Vicimus than the content of my other projects.
    - The other reason I included these last is that they are my oldest project in this repo, when I was practicing JS but was much less familiar with HTML and proper project structure.
    - I included these mostly because although my websites have included heavy use of Javascript, my HTML Experiments projects did not use JS, and I wanted to include some further examples of my JS work.
    - Please see the README files for each individual project for details
